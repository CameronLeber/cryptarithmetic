Cryptarithmetic/verbal arithmetic/alphametics are logic puzzles.
This example focuses on puzzles in base 10, thus a puzzle submitted may have no more than 10 letters total.

To run this example, first upload a text file under the puzzle_files folder.
For simplicity and to establish convention, ensure all letters are capitalized. 
On the command line in the main directory, run:

`python cryptarithm.py --filename="your_file.txt"`

For example, to submit the problem in the image above your text file would look like:
SEND + MORE = MONEY
